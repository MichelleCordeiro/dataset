The dataset includes 1130 images.
Handwriting are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
